# Champions Sports Camp

# Website Live Link: https://champions-sports-camp.web.app

This is a single page website about a summer sports campaign. It includes a list of sports teams and coach teaching their classes. Students can go to thew website and enroll to this classes.

- At Home page you will see a short photo gallery of our summer sports camp events. Then eventually our top instructors and out most popular classes.

- In this website I used Firebase Authentication for user authentication and security. Once registered everyone is an student here.

- Students can enroll a class by paying the displayed price of the classes. I used Stripe Payment system so students can pay for the course by cards.

- After a successful payment, students can see the payment history with all the transaction id.

- The admin can see all the users who have registered in this website. He can make anyone an Instructor or even an admin.

- An Instructor can add his own classes in the website. At first it will be pending. If the admin approves the class then it will be added to the UI. If admin don't approves the class, the can write a feedback about the denial of the class. Instructor can see the feedback in his added class collection page.

- I used a Dark Theme toggle for implementing dark theme.

- I used Express Js for server site and MongoDb for database.

- Used Axios and TenStack query for better performance.

- Used React awesome reveal for animation.
